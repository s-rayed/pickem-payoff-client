# Why did I make this you ask?

* Simple, because I want to see my friends do embarassing things!

* My friends and I have been betting on NBA games for years, sometimes online and sometimes with each other. This has never been about the money, rather more about bragging rights and the right to laugh at each other at every possible chance.

* I created this app so that we would have a platform for our bets and based it on Pickem' Plays which is a game played on an NBA daily show called The Starters!

* Every day each player must login to the app and pick the winner of the game displayed. The picks, scores and all game data is stored on a mongo database.

* The scores are tallied and a LOSER is determined every Sunday. The loser must do something embarassing in public. Yes, we go hard!
